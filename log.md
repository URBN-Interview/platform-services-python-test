# Init
- created repo and branch
- launched images from docker files and verified initial endpoint and UI are able to load properly

# Review
- customer data is hardcoded on html file
- data is coming from a form that does not have a name at this time
- looking through db there does not appear to be a table for customer data

# Reflection
- design decision - what would be the best user experience for percentage towards progress? ssee customer handler for more notes at the point that this decision was made
- errors so far are generally handled through logic and mongodb, definitely need to test if possible
